          The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios,
          erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name,
          by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
          World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of
          Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who had
          besieged it for a year with a large army and navy

          According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood
          approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high approximately
          the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown making
          it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed during the
          earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In
          accordance with a certain oracle, the Rhodians did not build it again.
          John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign re-erected the Colossus,
          but he was mistaken. According to the Suda, the Rhodians were called
          Colossaeans (Κολοσσαεῖς), because they erected the statue on the
          island.

        <p>
          In 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Muawiyah I conquered
          Rhodes, and according to the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor,
          the statue was completely destroyed and the remains sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2008, a series of as-yet-unrealized proposals to build a new
          Colossus at Rhodes Harbour have been announced, although the actual
          location of the original monument remains in dispute
